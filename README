#Hello welcome to my portfolio, to gain access to the posts, everything is in the contents folder and each folder within has all 
#the necessary documents and links.

###FOR THE GRAPHING DATA
# I have inserted a test csv file named TEST.csv, feel free to use that one if you'd like (it's a small excerpt of data from LanguageR dataset)

###FOR THE SWIRL LESSON
# I have inserted two documents, the lesson.yaml file where you can set the lesson from there and I have also added the swc file.
