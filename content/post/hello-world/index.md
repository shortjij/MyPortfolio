## About Me 

I am Juliana, a linguist who enjoys anything related _but not limited_ to:
* linguistics
* ancient history (_specifically Greece_) 
* art & music
* coffee

## Purpose of this Portfolio
**my target audience:**
- primarily be used for my fellow peers who may need to use R or any sort of programming language in their studies
- let them be able to see some programs which may be helpful for them. 
- Hopefully later I can format this portfolio to share with future employers

**the goal of this portfolio:** 
- provide resources to linguistics (i.e programs, small lessons)
- lessons for using R in general. 

**what program have I made:** 
- A Graphing App using Shiny
    - you can upload a csv file, select your X and Y variables and plot (still looking into that)
- A swirl program detailing the basics of a concept I have found hard at first: forloops
    - Talks about the way a forloop is written and why would we use one 
    - will get more questions further on 
- String information function 
    - Uses regular expressions to give you the # of words and # of vowels in the string input.
