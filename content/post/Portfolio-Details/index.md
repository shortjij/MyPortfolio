**my target audience:**
- primarily be used for my fellow peers who may need to use R or any sort of programming language in their studies
- let them be able to see some programs which may be helpful for them. 
- Hopefully later I can format this portfolio to share with future employers

**the goal of this portfolio:** 
- provide resources to linguistics (i.e programs, small lessons)
- lessons for using R in general. 

**what program ideas do I have:** 
- One idea I have is specifically for Praat in regards to help make it more efficient. 
    - make it easier to correct mistakes when defining an important characterstic. 
- A swirl program detailing the basics of a concept I may have found hard at first (i.e forloops/ifelse statements)
