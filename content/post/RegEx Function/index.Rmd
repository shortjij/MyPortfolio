One thing I made using regular expressions is a function which will count the words and vowels that input has. This would be very helpful and buildable for a linguist to use if they need to investigate a corpus data or perhaps looking at the length of utterances. The code is very buildable and can be changed to fit different aspects of linguistics using regular expressions. 
```{r}
string_info <- function(input){
  if(is.character(input) == TRUE){
    tolower(input)
    paste(tolower(input), "is a character with", stringr::str_count(input, "\\b\\w*\\b\\s"), "word(s) and this input has", stringr::str_count(input, "[aeiou]"), "vowels")
  } else if(is.character(input) == FALSE){
    print("invalid input")
  }
}
string_info('hello my name is Juliana')
```
